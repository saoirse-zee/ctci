# Cracking the Coding Interview in Javascript

Run tests:

```
npm test
```

or, to watch:

```
npx ava --watch
```

## Testing multiple solutions

Sometimes I want to try multiple solutions to a problem. It's nice to be able to run a new solution against a given battery of tests. See "1.2-permutation.test.js" for a way of doing this.

## Code style

Prettier runs on every commit, which keeps the formatting consistent. (See the "husky" section of package.json.)
